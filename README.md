# Medius Discord Bot

A Discord bot built for community servers running Medius servers such as [Clank](https://github.com/hashsploit/clank).

Written for the [Ratchet & Clank Online Discord Community](https://discord.gg/mUQzqGu).

While you can use WebHooks to publish event data from a Medius stack to Discord,
Medius Discord Bot allows users of a Discord server to send queries to the Medius
stack directly in a standardized way.

## Features

-   [x] Handle user chat commands.
-   [ ] Send user chat messages.
-   [ ] Send JSON query messages to a compatible MLS.
-   [ ] JQM Players.
-   [ ] JQM Games.
-   [ ] JQM Rank (leaderboards).
-   [x] Caching.
